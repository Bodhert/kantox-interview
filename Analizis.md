# Facts
- the core idea is **add**  products and is able to display the total price.
- there can be discounts based on some conditions, that are:
    - buy-one-get-one-free offers and of green tea: this mathematically means
that if the item list is pair, the checkout will be the half of the price,
    - if not will be the half of the size plus one item.
        If you buy 3 or more strawberries, the price should drop to Â£4.50 per strawberry (pretty straightforward)
    - If you buy 3 or more coffees, the price of all coffees should drop to two thirds of the original price(pretty straightforward).
- Our check-out can scan items in any order, and because the CEO and COO change their minds often, it needs to be flexible regarding our pricing rules: this means
that we will need to add the ability to quickly change or add Business rules

# Questions?:
- Will the final user will need the detail?
- how many user will be?
- is the program installed in each cash register, or is the cashier or each cash
machine going to communicate with us somehow?
- what will happen if a a new rule overlaps another rule.
- if the cashier goes down, do we need to recover the state?
- is the cashier going to input the whole input or only the codes?
- if error transaction, should it break or should continue?



# Tasks and considerations
- [ ] parse the input and verify that is a valid code
- [ ] use money, ex_money to handle the currency
- [ ] we need the ability to quickly add rules
- [ ] think and create cases that could break the checkout system. (a very long value) see how it behaves.

# nice to have:
- [ ] add coverage
- [ ] specs
- [ ] docs
- [ ] dockerize
